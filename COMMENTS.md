First what I did is look into api.spec.yaml to see what is the structure of the api.
And my first step is create the models, creating the diagram to see better the structure.
I saw that don't have any sense for me create a Model for the ImageGridResponse, the response will be generated by the
api, don't need to be into the ORM.
And im also creating a new Object for the Events stored on the ImageInfo Object.

Some variables were renamed for follow python language standards.

Field grid into the ImageInfo is not specification in the documentation, so I will imagine this is not important for
the moment, I will declare it on the model, but it doesn't have use on this app.

After create all the models, It's needed to create migrations package to create the tables in the database.

I decide order the ImageInfo directly on the model first by weight and then by date, I did this because
if we want to implement this algorithm for sort the images we will use it always, even if we want to filter by name we
want to have it also sorted by weight and date.

Next step is create the serializers that we are going to use with the models.
I will create a new package called serializers, in this app it's not necessary, but the idea of this api is to be
scalable, so I decided to create serializers package it is cleaner for me if we need to add more serializers for our API.
